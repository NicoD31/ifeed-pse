### iFeed

The goal of this project was to design a browser-based feedback system for data analysis. The application consists of test administration by a machine learning expert and test execution by one or more users with domain knowledge. The goal of the experiments is to find out if Active Learning is possible or useful. The user is supported by a descriptive preparation of the data during the execution.
